## Analysis

- The company has experienced substantial growth, with a year-over-year growth of 158%, resulting in a revenue of $1.27M
- A total of 830 orders were executed and $64.9k was used to deliver these orders
- On average, each order incurs a freight cost of $78, but the company earns a profit of $1.4k per order
- Quick Stop is the best customer. But Save-a-lot-markets and Ernst Handle posted the best year-over-year growth, at 318% and 199%, respectively
- The average discount is 5.6%. Meat and poultry products receive the highest discount
- Beverages and dairy account for nearly 40% of sales
- The maximum order intake occurs in the first quarter
- The company delivers more than 95% of its orders on time/early

## Suggestions

- When in a particular week there is an increase in revenue, the following week immediately sees a sharp decrease in revenue. This should be monitored to verify consistency and effectiveness at all levels of the company
- The company performed exceptionally well in the first quarter. Special campaigns should be launched in the remaining quarters to improve sales
- Seafood is the fastest growing category with an annual growth rate of more than 200%. It would be wise to capitalize on this growth and strategically allocate resources to further drive the category's growth
- Shipping contracts should be renegotiated with United Package because it is the most expensive and has the lowest delivery success rate
