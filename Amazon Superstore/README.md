## Analysis


- The company has generated sales worth $12.64 M up to now. 
- The company's return rate of only 4.19% is remarkable, especially when compared to the industry standard range of 20-30%.
- The consumer segment is responsible for driving the highest amount of sales. 
- There is a higher demand for products in the technology and office-supplies category.
- The highest sales are recorded in the USA, Australia, and France. 
- Customers prefer to use the Standard Class shipping mode. 
## Suggestions

- Due to the high demand for office supplies, efforts should be undertaken to improve sales in the Corporate Segment.This can be achieved by providing specific discounts or promotional offers.

- Printers are one of the least profitable products, so it is necessary to develop new strategies to increase their profitability or consider discontinuing their sale. 
- Currently, the company has little to no exposure in the South Asian market. Expanding into this market, which has a large population, will undoubtedly contribute to revenue growth.
